## How can I contribute to DMC-Complete?

Contributions are welcome from anyone. As they say in Ratatouille - anyone can cook! 🐀🥘👨🏻‍🍳

You can help by raising issues for bugs or feature requests and you can even address open issues by contributing to the code yourself.

#### Did you find a bug or an error?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fadilf/DMC-Complete/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fadilf/DMC-Complete/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **reproducible test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable. Avoid committing files that are not directly related to the patch, e.g., file changes caused by slight wiring changes or change of visible case structure case.

#### **Do you have a feature suggestion you'd like to see implemented?**

* Suggest your change as an issue with the `enhancement` tag. Make sure to include as much detail as you think might be helpful to understand how the feature might be helpful.

* If you'd like to implement the feature yourself, feel free to volunteer in the issue thread. You can fork the repository and create a pull request when you've developed it. [Here](https://github.com/fadilf/DMC-Complete/issues/1) is a great example of an issue and pull-request.
